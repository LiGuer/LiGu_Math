* Topological Space & Open Set
  - Define  
    Topological space $\tau$ is a collection of subsets of $S$, called the Open Sets, that satisfy certain axioms,

    - The empty set and $S$ itself belong to $\tau$.
      $$\{\emptyset, S\} \subseteq \tau$$ 
    - The intersection of any finite members of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.
    - Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of members of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.

  - Concept
    * Closed Set
      - Define  
        Closed Set is the complementary set of Open Set.
