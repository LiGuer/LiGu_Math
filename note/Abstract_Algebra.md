* Abstract Algebra
  * Group
    - Define  
      Group is a pair $(G, ·)$, where $G$ is a set, $·$ is a binary operation, and satisfy:
      - associative law $(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)$
      - $\exists 1: x · 1 = 1 · x = xs$
      - $\exists x': x · x' = x' · x = 1$
    
    - Property
      - $1$ is unique
        - Proof
          $1_1 = 1_1 · 1_2 = 1_2$

    - Include
      * Commutative Group
        - Define  
          A Group satisfying commutative law $a · b = b · a$.

  * Ring
    - Define  
      Ring is a pair $(G, +, ·)$, where $G$ is a set, $·$ and $+$ are binary operations, and satisfy:  
      - $(G, +)$ is Commutative Group
      - $(G, ·)$ satisfy associative law
      - Distributive law
        $$\begin{align*}
          a · (b + c) &= a · b + a · c  \\
          (b + c) · a &= b · a + c · a
        \end{align*}$$

    - Include
      * Commutative Ring
        - Define  
          A Ring satisfying commutative law.
